* This module is updated model of the previous model I showed in repostories teaching model 1.1, which I showed previously.
* The data where I conduct analysis is an updated data used in the module 1.
* In this module, I gave more visual description to the updated data in order to provide an overview of the data and to explore more problems we are concerned. From analysis to the data, I provide a further analysis by statistics as well as machine learning techniques. 
* In the upcoming few modules, I will conduct dimensional reduction analysis, then proceed to feature selection, model evaluation and modle prediction.
